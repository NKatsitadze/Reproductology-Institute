Gained a great experience, improved my skills in TS and React Router, learnt using new libraries and made webpage multi language, used lazyloading and decreased website loading time, squooshed images and decreased sizes but retained high quality, optimized it for every browser and every screen size above 320px width. Also made a design, chose colors and learnt some important UI/UX.
