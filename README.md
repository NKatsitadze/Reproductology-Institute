My first real world project, Reproductology clinic website, that I'm making with React router, 
considered slick or splide for responsive swipeable carousel, integrated google maps,
added hamburger menu for small tablets and phones, added error page and loading page.
Used i18n library for adding English language.
I've planned to add Russian too in near future, and editing some minor styles,
changing hero image and placing there whole screen carousel, I may change slick library 
with splide and definitely will add facebook messanger plugin to website, with
other upgrades.
Design was also done by me, I chose neutral and calm colors for website, as staff
did not want it to be too fancy, I used exact colors from clinic logo.

"Website is still in production, waiting for upgrades as soon as possible"
